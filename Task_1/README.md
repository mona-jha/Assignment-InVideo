# Image Face Detection and Cropping Tool

This Rust application detects faces in images and creates center-cropped versions focused on the detected faces. It uses a TorchScript model for face detection and OpenCV for image processing.

## Features

- Face detection using a PyTorch model
- Automatic center-cropping around detected faces
- Batch processing of images in a directory
- Configurable confidence threshold for detection
